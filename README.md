# Summary
[Click me to skip to downloads.](https://github.com/moefingers/convertShiftInsertToCtrlV-in-Git-Bash?tab=readme-ov-file#downloads)

This program will allow you to send "shift + insert" key to paste when you input "ctrl + v" instead of whatever else happens. Especially useful for short keyboards, or if you just don't want to adapt.

This is a program written in a [AutoHotKey, or AHK for short](https://www.autohotkey.com/). A free, open-source scripting language.

# Tips 

After deciding where to save this program, I've had friends mention they create a shortcut and add it to startup! The place to add your shortcut would be in `"%APPDATA%\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup"`
